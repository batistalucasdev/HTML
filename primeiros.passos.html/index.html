        <b>Take Me Home, Country Roads</b><br>
        <i>Song by John Denver</i><br>
        <br>
        Almost heaven, West Virginia<br>
        Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River<br>
        Life is old there, older than the trees<br>
        Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze<br>
        Country roads, take me home<br>
        To the place I belong<br>
        West Virginia, mountain mama<br>
        Take me home, country roads<br>
        All my memories gather 'round her<br>
        Miner's lady, stranger to blue water<br>
        Dark and dusty, painted on the sky<br>
        Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye<br>
        Country roads, take me home<br>
        To the place I belong<br>
        West Virginia, mountain mama<br>
        Take me home, country roads<br>
        I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me<br>
        The radio reminds me of my home far away<br>
        Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'<br>
        That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday<br>
        Country roads, take me home<br>
        To the place I belong<br>
        West Virginia, mountain mama<br>
        Take me home, country roads<br>
        Country roads, take me home<br>
        To the place I belong<br>
        West Virginia, mountain mama<br>
        Take me home, country roads<br>
        Take me home, (down) country roads<br>
        Take me home, (down) country roads
