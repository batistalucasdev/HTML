				<p>Look<br>
					If you had one shot or one opportunity<br>
					To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment<br>
					Would you capture it<br>
					Or just let it slip? Yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
					There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
					He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
					To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'<br>
					What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
					He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
					He's chokin' how everybody's jokin' now<br>
					The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow<br>
					Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity, ope<br>
					There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't<br>
					Give up that easy, no, he won't have it<br>
					He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope<br>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>You better</p>

				<p>
					His soul's escapin' through this hole that is gapin'<br>
					This world is mine for the takin', make me king<br>
					As we move toward a new world order<br>
					A normal life is borin', but superstardom's<br>
					Close to postmortem, it only grows harder<br>
					Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br>
					These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br>
					He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br>
					God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
					He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
					But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
					These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product<br>
					They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
					He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>
					Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br>
					But the beat goes on<br>
					Da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>You better</p>

				<p>
					No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
					Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
					I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed<br>
					I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
					But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
					Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
					All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
					Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-five<br>
					And I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br>
					'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
					And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
					And these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder<br>
					Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br>
					Caught up between being a father and a prima donna<br>
					Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br>
					Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br>
					Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br>
					To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>
					Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>
					Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go<br>
					I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
					So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not<br>
					This may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>

				<p>You better</p>

				<p>(You can do anything you set your mind to, man)</p>

			<p><i>Letra (Lyrics)</i></p>

			<p>
				May I have your attention, please?<br>
				May I have your attention, please?<br>
				Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
				I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
				We're gonna have a problem here<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Y'all act like you never seen a white person before<br>
				Jaws all on the floor, like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door<br>
				And started whoopin' her ass worse than before<br>
				They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)<br>
				It's the return of the: Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding<br>
				He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?<br>
				And Dr. Dre said: Nothing, you idiots!<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)<br>
				Feminist women love Eminem<br>
				Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him<br>
				Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what<br>
				Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though<br>
				Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose<br>
				But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms<br>
				Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose<br>
				But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose<br>
				My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips<br>
				And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss<br>
				And that's the message that we deliver to little kids<br>
				And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is<br>
				Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is<br>
				By the time they hit fourth grade<br>
				They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				We ain't nothin' but mammals<br>
				Well, some of us, cannibals<br>
				Who cut other people open like cantaloupes<br>
				But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes<br>
				Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope<br>
				But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote<br>
				Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
				So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
				Please stand up, please stand up?
			</p>

			<p>
				'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
				So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
				Please stand up, please stand up?
			</p>

			<p>
				Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
				Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
				You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
				Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
				But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
				Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
				So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
				Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
				So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
				And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
				Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
			</p>

			<p>
				Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee
				I should download her audio on MP3
				And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (agh!)
				I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
				All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
				And there's a million of us just like me
				Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
				Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
				And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
			</p>

				<p>
				I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
				So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
				Please stand up, please stand up?
			</p>

			<p>
				'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
				So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
				Please stand up, please stand up?
